# Performance Engineering Research

A structured research portfolio focused on distributed systems performance, scalability optimization, and latency-aware system design.

---

## Research Focus

- Distributed systems performance
- Latency-aware load balancing
- Scalability engineering
- Microservices optimization
- Throughput and bottleneck analysis
- Experimental benchmarking

This repository is built with a research-first mindset — not as a collection of random projects.

## Research Philosophy

Performance engineering is not about building systems.
It is about measuring, analyzing, and improving them.

Core principles followed:

1. Identify a precise technical problem.
2. Study existing research solutions.
3. Reproduce baseline implementations.
4. Identify limitations.
5. Propose measurable improvements.
6. Validate results through controlled experiments.

## Performance Metrics of Interest

- Throughput (requests per unit time)
- Latency (response time per request)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Scalability under increasing load
- Failure tolerance and recovery behavior

---

## Long-Term Objective

- Develop publishable research contribution
- Build strong analytical foundation for graduate-level systems research
- Prepare for advanced research opportunities in Japan
